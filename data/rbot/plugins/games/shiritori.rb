#
# Shiritori is a word game where a few people take turns to continue a chain of words.
# To continue a word, the next word must start with the ending of the previous word,
# usually defined as the one to few letters/characters at the end. This plugin allows
# playing several games, each per channel. A game can be turn-based, where only new
# players can interrupt a turn to join, or a free mode where anyone can speak at any
# time.
#
# In Japanese mode, if present, the plugin can use normalize-japanese
# <http://neruchan.mine.nu:60880/normalize-japanese.rb> to allow
# katakana words be used like hiragana.
#
# TODO
# * a system to describe settings, so they can be displayed, changed and saved
# * adjust settings during game
# * allow other definitions of continues?
# * read default settings from configuration
# * keep statistics
# * other forms of dictionaries
