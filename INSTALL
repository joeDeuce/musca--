Run setup.rb to install the bot.

Just run rbot, it'll ask you for any core information it needs before it can
start, after that you can configure everything else online using the config
module.

You can maintain multiple configurations at once. Start rbot with the
location you want it to store runtime data in. By default, running rbot
uses the ~/.rbot config directory. If you run 'rbot /path/to/foo', then the
configuration will be stored to and read from there instead.
